# ML ImageAnalysis
 Grad level machine learning for image analysis

See A1/A2/A3 for each pset! 

In A1, we implemented gradient descent for image denoting and Fourier transforms for limiting high frequency pixels (hence blurring the image).

In A2, we implemented Principal Component Analysis for an image (PCA), and we also performed Geodesic Shooting for Image Registration.

In A3, we worked with multivariate regression as well as image classification.

For our final project, we worked with cutting-edge augmentation algorithm RandAugment! See /Final Project/RandAugmentTest/ for details.
