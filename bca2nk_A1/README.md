Welcome to my first problemset for 4501 MLIA! :)

Hopefully this will be easy to read, but feel free to contact me at kunshksingh@gmail.com for any comments/concerns. (Quick tip: If requirements.txt doesn't work, please check which Python Interpreter you are using; this issue happened to me when I started on this pset)

PDF Submission

My main PDF submission is in the root and is known as "bca2nk_A1_report.pdf". ps1.pdf is just the questions.

If you would just like to see my Problem 3 for my gradient descent, then *skip to page 10*.

However, if you are interested in my thought process for Problem 1 and Problem 2, see pages 1-9 in the PDF.

My 4 .jpeg's titled "1 Associativity", "1 Differentiation", "1 Distributive", and "1 Fourier" are handwrittenproofs for Problem 1, with brief explanations for each step and a brief conclusion on each. This can also be seen in pages 2-5 in the PDF. 

My 2 .png titled "2A" and "2B&C" are my respective outputs to parts 2A and 2B&C in Problem 2. A further explanation for Problem 2 can be see from pages 6-9 in the PDF.

My 6 .png's titled "3 0.01 Noise In", "3 0.01 Noise Out", "3 0.05 Noise In", "3 0.05 Noise Out", "3 0.1 Noise In", "3 0.1 Noise Out" are all test IOs for my gradient descent algorithm in Problem 3. This can be seen from pages 10-13 in the PDF.


Code Submissions

All code can be found in the "code > Python" folder. "fourierTransform.py" is my code for Problem 2 and has annotations denoting my thought process and sections denoting each part (a, b, and c). "gradientDescent.py" includes my gradient descent algorithm for Problem 3 and has many parts in different sections, including input, outputs, constants, gradient descent algorithm, and methods created/used.

For fourierTransform.py, running it once will give the proper output for 2A. Closing out the output (using the x in the top left) for 2A will show the proper output for 2B&C.

<p style ="text-decoration=none">For gradientDescent.py, the inputs leading to the noisy Lena in Problem 3 will be shown first. Closing out the input (using the x in the top left) will then eventually show us our denoised Lena along with the respective energy plot. This will repeat for sigma/noise values of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 (you will be able to close the plot a total of 6 times before the program stops running).</p>

Thank you once again for looking at my first problem set! Understanding/implementing/writing about gradient descent alone took me ~20 hours so I do not know how much my entire problem set took, but I do know that I enjoyed it a lot! Having someone read my hard work means a lot to me!
